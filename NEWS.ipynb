Adding a bit over 200,000 jobs a month is both what analysts thought would happen, and also a trajectory that is consistent with a continued slow decline in unemployment but no real labor market boom.\\n\\nDive deeper into the data, and the basic lack of surprises only continues. Labor force participation is up, but only very slightly. Hourly wages are up, but only very slightly.\\n\\nThere's nothing about this jobs report that is likely to change the Federal Reserve's mind about anything, and therefore no reason to expect financial markets to have any particular reaction. Those who think the Fed's current course is dangerously inflationary will keep thinking that. Those who (more correctly!) think the Fed's current course is unreasonably inflation-averse will keep thinking that, as well. Janet Yellen will keep thinking she's on the right track.\\n\\nWage growth appears to have settled into a steady pattern that is somewhat better than what we saw at the depths of the recession, but far below what was considered normal before the recession. Partially offsetting this, overall consumer price inflation has been abnormally low for a couple of years now. There are also some compositional effects pulling average wages down as a large cohort of inexperienced 20-somethings have been entering the workforce.\\n\\nOverall it is a little difficult to understand why some of the small upward bumps have been interpreted in some quarters as a sign of an imminent inflationary breakout. Even the strongest wage-growth months have been weak compared with 2006 or 2007, years that were not exactly halcyon days for the American worker.\\n\\nPerhaps the clearest sign of how not-yet-completed America's recovery comes from looking at the level of full-time jobs, which is still well below where it was in 2007:\\n\\nThe population, needless to say, has grown in the intervening years, meaning that the failure to fully catch up in job growth makes it difficult for rank-and-file workers to gain bargaining leverage.\",\n          \"President Barack Obama's popularity with the public is on the upswing, according to a new Gallup poll that found him enjoying his strongest approval rating in nearly two years.\\n\\nThat breaks down predictably along party lines, with 90% of Democrats viewing him favorably while only 13% of Republicans say the same. The overall boost in popularity seems to be driven in part by a steady improvement in his standing with independents \\u2014\\u00a0he's now seen favorably by 52% of independents, up 6 percentage points since April and 17 percentage points since last fall.\\n\\nThat's when Obama was suffering from the lowest popularity his tenure, with only 37% of Americans viewing him favorably last fall.\\n\\nBut the 53% of Americans that view him favorably don't all approve of his job performance, which typically lags a few points behind a president's personal popularity. Gallup's daily tracking poll found him still underwater with voters in terms of his job performance, with 43% approving while 51% disapprove of the job he's doing in office.\\n\\nStill, that, too marks a favorable upswing from last fall, when Obama was also facing some of the lowest approval ratings of his time in office. Gallup surveyed 1,024 adults from May 6-10 via landline and cell phone, and the poll has a margin of error of 4%.\",\n          \"Elderly Woman Spots Drone Above Property\\u2026 Her Next Move Leaves Operators STUNNED \\nHough recalled waking up to the sound of glass breaking and footsteps inside his home as the intruder used a rock to smash out a sliding glass door. \\n\\u201cIt was a strong guy, a big guy,\\u201d Hough said, referencing his broken door. \\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t have been able to kick that out.\\u201d \\nGrabbing his revolver, Hough took up a defensive position at the top of the stairs and waited until he saw the man who had broken into his home.   \\n\\u201cI knew pretty much where he was,\\u201d he explained. \\u201cHe came across my dining room and to the foot of my stairway.

Adding a bit over 200,000 jobs a month is both what analysts thought would happen, and also a trajectory that is consistent with a continued slow decline in unemployment but no real labor market boom.\\n\\nDive deeper into the data, and the basic lack of surprises only continues. Labor force participation is up, but only very slightly. Hourly wages are up, but only very slightly.\\n\\nThere's nothing about this jobs report that is likely to change the Federal Reserve's mind about anything, and therefore no reason to expect financial markets to have any particular reaction. Those who think the Fed's current course is dangerously inflationary will keep thinking that. Those who (more correctly!) think the Fed's current course is unreasonably inflation-averse will keep thinking that, as well. Janet Yellen will keep thinking she's on the right track.\\n\\nWage growth appears to have settled into a steady pattern that is somewhat better than what we saw at the depths of the recession, but far below what was considered normal before the recession. Partially offsetting this, overall consumer price inflation has been abnormally low for a couple of years now. There are also some compositional effects pulling average wages down as a large cohort of inexperienced 20-somethings have been entering the workforce.\\n\\nOverall it is a little difficult to understand why some of the small upward bumps have been interpreted in some quarters as a sign of an imminent inflationary breakout. Even the strongest wage-growth months have been weak compared with 2006 or 2007, years that were not exactly halcyon days for the American worker.\\n\\nPerhaps the clearest sign of how not-yet-completed America's recovery comes from looking at the level of full-time jobs, which is still well below where it was in 2007:\\n\\nThe population, needless to say, has grown in the intervening years, meaning that the failure to fully catch up in job growth makes it difficult for rank-and-file workers to gain bargaining leverage.\",\n          \"President Barack Obama's popularity with the public is on the upswing, according to a new Gallup poll that found him enjoying his strongest approval rating in nearly two years.\\n\\nThat breaks down predictably along party lines, with 90% of Democrats viewing him favorably while only 13% of Republicans say the same. The overall boost in popularity seems to be driven in part by a steady improvement in his standing with independents \\u2014\\u00a0he's now seen favorably by 52% of independents, up 6 percentage points since April and 17 percentage points since last fall.\\n\\nThat's when Obama was suffering from the lowest popularity his tenure, with only 37% of Americans viewing him favorably last fall.\\n\\nBut the 53% of Americans that view him favorably don't all approve of his job performance, which typically lags a few points behind a president's personal popularity. Gallup's daily tracking poll found him still underwater with voters in terms of his job performance, with 43% approving while 51% disapprove of the job he's doing in office.\\n\\nStill, that, too marks a favorable upswing from last fall, when Obama was also facing some of the lowest approval ratings of his time in office. Gallup surveyed 1,024 adults from May 6-10 via landline and cell phone, and the poll has a margin of error of 4%.\",\n          \"Elderly Woman Spots Drone Above Property\\u2026 Her Next Move Leaves Operators STUNNED \\nHough recalled waking up to the sound of glass breaking and footsteps inside his home as the intruder used a rock to smash out a sliding glass door. \\n\\u201cIt was a strong guy, a big guy,\\u201d Hough said, referencing his broken door. \\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t have been able to kick that out.\\u201d \\nGrabbing his revolver, Hough took up a defensive position at the top of the stairs and waited until he saw the man who had broken into his home.   \\n\\u201cI knew pretty much where he was,\\u201d he explained. \\u201cHe came across my dining room and to the foot of my stairway.

Her third-graders, for one, take 14 standardized tests, including Common Core ones, each year.\\n\\nThird-grade students at Sylvanie Williams College Prep elementary school read individually in class, on Jan. 16, 2015, in New Orleans. Fifty percent of the children here started the academic year below grade level in reading and math. The goal is to help them catch up and keep making progress.\\n\\nThis story is the third in a yearlong series following Krystal Hardy, a first-year principal trying to bring order and improve test scores at a struggling New Orleans charter school. The project is a partnership between The Christian Science Monitor and The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news outlet that covers inequality and innovation in education and is affiliated with Teachers College, Columbia University.\\n\\nA week before their final round of Common Core tests, the fifth-graders at Sylvanie Williams College Prep, a charter school in New Orleans, are reviewing the procedures for solving a multi-part word problem in math. Their principal, Krystal Hardy, looks on.\\n\\n\\u201cPay attention! I\\u2019ve seen these kinds of questions on the PARCC test,\\u201d says math teacher Tiffany Labrie, referring to the Common Core tests that most students in Louisiana take this month. \\u201cThis calls for converting ounces to pounds, so you can use your reference sheet,\\u201d she tells them, indicating a handout on every desk.\\n\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t forget, you can use the reference sheet today, but also on the what?\\u201d asks Ms. Labrie, rhetorically.\\n\\n\\u201cPARCC!\\u201d echoes Labrie. \\u201cYou\\u2019ll have those reference sheets during the PARCC tests. Remember to use them!\\u201d\\n\\nMs. Hardy \\u2013 who is in her first year as principal \\u2013 has staked her career on improving the culture and upping the test scores at this struggling elementary school, located in a gritty part of New Orleans' Central City neighborhood. At the start of the academic year in August, 50 percent of the approximately 400 students, nearly all of whom are African-American and most of whom are poor, scored below grade level in reading and math. Their road to improvement is paved with tests.\\n\\nIndeed, like most public school students across America, pupils at Sylvanie Williams get tested often \\u2013 although Hardy is trying to balance the \\u201cdata-driven instruction\\u201d with a strong social justice curriculum.\\n\\nThe earliest tests this year helped teachers figure out which students had learned the material and which ones needed that lesson again. After five months, Hardy and her staff began diving deeper, comparing test results with worksheets that students completed in class. When they saw patterns of errors, the teachers themselves worked through the problems, trying to figure out exactly where the students were going wrong.\\n\\nTheir findings have already dramatically changed the way teachers teach. And the teachers are noticing that student achievement is picking up.\\n\\n\\u201cWe were able to administer targeted medicine,\\u201d says Hardy.\\n\\n\\u201cInstead of saying, \\u2018Some of these students aren\\u2019t good at multiplying,\\u2019 \\u201d she says, \\u201cwe could start to say, for example, that 40 percent of these students in this class don\\u2019t seem to understand the place-value concept in three-digit numbers and about 40 percent, say, understand the concept but are not paying attention to details when they compute.\\u201d\\n\\nStudents at Sylvanie Williams take annual tests in science and social studies aligned to the state\\u2019s standards, plus two rounds of Common Core tests in English and math developed by the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC). In some grades, students also take three sets of benchmarking tests three or four times a year. In the end, third-graders, who get tested the most, take a whopping 14 standardized tests per year, in addition to \\u201cexit tickets\\u201d \\u2013 teacher-generated assessments at the end of a unit of study.\\n\\nTesting infuses many aspects of the school day. The walls of Hardy\\u2019s office and the teachers\\u2019 conference room are hung with posters sporting bar charts that show test results. Students and teachers talk about the test, the test day, and \\u201creaching basic.\\u201d\\n\\nOutside a third-grade classroom, a colorful hand-drawn poster names the children who have achieved the advanced, mastery, and basic levels on one test. In another classroom, a teacher has written out in magic marker a several-foot-long list of standards (4.NF.5: Express equivalent fractions and add fractions with denominators of 10 and 100) \\u2013 presumably to keep his own teaching on target for the Common Core math test.\\n\\nAlthough a vocal minority of parents whose children tend to be enrolled in more affluent schools around the country have refused to let their kids take the Common Core tests, no Sylvanie Williams families have opted out. And Hardy is predicting the final round won\\u2019t be a problem for her scholars. \\u201cThey\\u2019re used to it,\\u201d she says simply.\\n\\nEarly in the year, diagnostic test results helped distinguish what had been taught from what had been learned. Hardy keeps a close eye on lesson plans \\u2013 teachers submit them to her each week \\u2013 so she knows what material is being covered.\\n\\nBy January, armed with more data, Hardy and her teachers and coaches were really poring over the test results. And that\\u2019s when the dialogue around instruction began to shift. The teachers started collaborating on how to quickly and directly backfill the specific foundational skills that students need to move forward.\\n\\n\\u201cAfter that point,\\u201d says fourth-grade teacher Terrance Mitchell, \\u201cI think as a school we really started to see the achievement of our students begin to accelerate.\\u201d\\n\\nAlthough Hardy is committed to running a test-driven school, the data focus has its frustrations. Because the Common Core exams are new this year, the PARCC administrators need to perform technical calculations on the results. This means that scores on the tests will be released to Hardy after Sylvanie Williams\\u2019s school year ends \\u2013 too late for teachers to use that data to course-correct.\\n\\nState political leaders are maneuvering to scuttle or at least modify the use of the Common Core in Louisiana, so it\\u2019s not certain that the standards that the students are being asked to meet this year will even be around next year.\\n\\nThe school\\u2019s relentless focus on standards and testing reduces time for less defined but often more meaningful types of lessons \\u2013 ones that help kids understand themselves, their fellow students, and the world around them. But Hardy has tried to squeeze these kinds of experiences into the school day.\\n\\nIn January, she took 40 students on a field trip to Selma, Ala., to join the commemorations of the 50th anniversary of the march to Montgomery. And one morning, she taught a unit on poverty in America, which included having third-, fourth-, and fifth-graders compare weekly expenses with median income for high school dropouts, college graduates, and those with a master\\u2019s degree.\\n\\nRecently, a fifth-grade blackboard showed the remnants of a vibrant discussion about young black men, police, and excessive force. \\u201cBecause of the demographic our children come from, many will face immense challenges and unique realities,\\u201d Hardy says.\\n\\n\\u201cWe need to prepare them to understand how the world will engage with them. They need to understand how to engage with it. And maybe, create the possibility that they will act as change agents in their world.\\u201d\\n\\nHardy accepts that her school, and her tenure as principal, will be evaluated largely on test scores. But she is adamant about maintaining what she sees as crucial parts of education that no test will measure.\\n\\n\\u2022 This project is a partnership between the Monitor and The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news website focused on inequality and innovation in education and is affiliated with Teachers College, Columbia University. \\u00a9 2015 The Christian Science Monitor and The Hechinger Report.\",\n          \"By wmw_admin on October 31, 2016 Ed Klein \\u2014 DailyMail.com Oct 30, 2016 \\nNew York Times bestselling author Ed Klein has just published his fourth book about the Clintons since 2005, Guilty as Sin. \\nKlein had told how Bill Clinton enjoyed foot rubs, massages and romps in his presidential library with female interns and has described new details about Hillary\\u2019s medical crises. Guilty as Sin is available in bookstores and for order from Amazon. \\nJames Comey\\u2019s decision to revive the investigation of Hillary Clinton\\u2019s email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI, including some of his top deputies, according to a source close to the embattled FBI director. \\n\\u2018The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldn\\u2019t recommend an indictment against Hillary,\\u2019 said the source, a close friend who has known Comey for nearly two decades, shares family outings with him, and accompanies him to Catholic mass every week. \\n\\u2018Some people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,\\u2019 said the source. \\u2018They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist.\\u2019 \\nAccording to the source, Comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife, Patrice. \\nHe told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom \\n\\u2018He\\u2019s been ignoring the resignation letters in the hope that he could find a way of remedying the situation,\\u2019 said the source. \\n\\u2018When new emails that appeared to be related to Hillary\\u2019s personal email server turned up in a computer used [her close aide] Huma Abedin and [Abedin\\u2019s disgraced husband,] Anthony Weiner, Comey jumped at the excuse to reopen the investigation. \\n\\u2018The people he trusts the most have been the angriest at him,\\u2019 the source continued. \\u2018And that includes his wife, Pat. She kept urging him to admit that he had been wrong when he refused to press charges against the former secretary of state. \\n\\u2018He talks about the damage that he\\u2019s done to himself and the institution [of the FBI], and how he\\u2019s been shunned by the men and women who he admires and work for him. It\\u2019s taken a tremendous toll on him. \\n\\u2018It shattered his ego. He looks like he\\u2019s aged 10 years in the past four months.\\u2019 \\nBut Comey\\u2019s decision to reopen the case was more than an effort to heal the wound he inflicted on the FBI. \\nHe was also worried that after the presidential election, Republicans in Congress would mount a probe of how he had granted Hillary political favoritism. \\nHis announcement about the revived investigation, which came just 11 days before the presidential election, was greeted with shock and dismay by Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the prosecutors at the Justice Department. \\n\\u2018Jim told me that Lynch and Obama are furious with him,\\u2019 the source said. \\nAs I revealed in my latest New York Times bestseller Guilty As Sin Obama said that appointing Comey as FBI direct was \\u2018my worst mistake as president.\\u2019 \\n\\u2018Lynch and Obama haven\\u2019t contacted Jim directly,\\u2019 said the source, \\u2018but they\\u2019ve made it crystal clear through third parties that they disapprove of his effort to save face.\\u2019\",\n          \"Paul Joseph Watson Senior British army officer and former deputy supreme allied commander Europe Gen. Sir Richard Shirreff warns that NATO faces \\u201cnuclear war with Russia in Europe,\\u201d and that America is already technically at war with Russia. In a hawkish article for CNN , Shirreff asserts that the west faces the biggest threat from Russia since the Cold War and that Vladmir Putin plans to \\u201cre-establish Russia\\u2019s status as one of the world\\u2019s great powers\\u201d by marching into the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Comparing the west\\u2019s policy towards Putin to the appeasement of Hitler, Shirreff claims that Moscow, \\u201cmay have already lit the fuse that could lead to the unthinkable: nuclear war with Russia in Europe.\\u201d Under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, an attack on one NATO member country represents an attack on all member countries, meaning the United States would be at war with Russia if Russian troops set foot in Baltic countries. \\u201cA Russian attack on the Baltic states puts America at war with Russia \\u2014 meaning nuclear war, because Russia integrates nuclear weapons into every aspect of its military doctrine,\\u201d writes Shirreff. He also states that \\u201cRussia is at war with America already,\\u201d recycling the claim, which remains unproven, that Russia is behind the email hacks that led to Wikileaks\\u2019 publicizing of Clinton campaign emails. \\u201cAnd don\\u2019t think Russia would limit itself to the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe.

    \"Principal Krystal Hardy has dedicated herself to improving the culture and upping the test scores at a struggling New Orleans charter school Her thirdgraders for one take 14 standardized tests including Common Core ones each year\\n\\nThirdgrade students at Sylvanie Williams College Prep elementary school read individually in class on Jan 16 2015 in New Orleans Fifty percent of the children here started the academic year below grade level in reading and math The goal is to help them catch up and keep making progress\\n\\nThis story is the third in a yearlong series following Krystal Hardy a firstyear principal trying to bring order and improve test scores at a struggling New Orleans charter school The project is a partnership between The Christian Science Monitor and The Hechinger Report a nonprofit nonpartisan news outlet that covers inequality and innovation in education and is affiliated with Teachers College Columbia University\\n\\nA week before their final round of Common Core tests the fifthgraders at Sylvanie Williams College Prep a charter school in New Orleans are reviewing the procedures for solving a multipart word problem in math Their principal Krystal Hardy looks on\\n\\n\\u201cPay attention I\\u2019ve seen these kinds of questions on the PARCC test\\u201d says math teacher Tiffany Labrie referring to the Common Core tests that most students in Louisiana take this month \\u201cThis calls for converting ounces to pounds so you can use your reference sheet\\u201d she tells them indicating a handout on every desk\\n\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t forget you can use the reference sheet today but also on the what\\u201d asks Ms Labrie rhetorically\\n\\n\\u201cPARCC\\u201d echoes Labrie \\u201cYou\\u2019ll have those reference sheets during the PARCC tests Remember to use them\\u201d\\n\\nMs Hardy \\u2013 who is in her first year as principal \\u2013 has staked her career on improving the culture and upping the test scores at this struggling elementary school located in a gritty part of New Orleans Central City neighborhood At the start of the academic year in August 50 percent of the approximately 400 students nearly all of whom are AfricanAmerican and most of whom are poor scored below grade level in reading and math Their road to improvement is paved with tests\\n\\nIndeed like most public school students across America pupils at Sylvanie Williams get tested often \\u2013 although Hardy is trying to balance the \\u201cdatadriven instruction\\u201d with a strong social justice curriculum\\n\\nThe earliest tests this year helped teachers figure out which students had learned the material and which ones needed that lesson again After five months Hardy and her staff began diving deeper comparing test results with worksheets that students completed in class When they saw patterns of errors the teachers themselves worked through the problems trying to figure out exactly where the students were going wrong\\n\\nTheir findings have already dramatically changed the way teachers teach And the teachers are noticing that student achievement is picking up\\n\\n\\u201cWe were able to administer targeted medicine\\u201d says Hardy\\n\\n\\u201cInstead of saying \\u2018Some of these students aren\\u2019t good at multiplying\\u2019 \\u201d she says \\u201cwe could start to say for example that 40 percent of these students in this class don\\u2019t seem to understand the placevalue concept in threedigit numbers and about 40 percent say understand the concept but are not paying attention to details when they compute\\u201d\\n\\nStudents at Sylvanie Williams take annual tests in science and social studies aligned to the state\\u2019s standards plus two rounds of Common Core tests in English and math developed by the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers PARCC In some grades students also take three sets of benchmarking tests three or four times a year In the end thirdgraders who get tested the most take a whopping 14 standardized tests per year in addition to \\u201cexit tickets\\u201d \\u2013 teachergenerated assessments at the end of a unit of study\\n\\nTesting infuses many aspects of the school day The walls of Hardy\\u2019s office and the teachers\\u2019 conference room are hung with posters sporting bar charts that show test results Students and teachers talk about the test the test day and \\u201creaching basic\\u201d\\n\\nOutside a thirdgrade classroom a colorful handdrawn poster names the children who have achieved the advanced mastery and basic levels on one test In another classroom a teacher has written out in magic marker a severalfootlong list of standards 4NF5 Express equivalent fractions and add fractions with denominators of 10 and 100 \\u2013 presumably to keep his own teaching on target for the Common Core math test\\n\\nAlthough a vocal minority of parents whose children tend to be enrolled in more affluent schools around the country have refused to let their kids take the Common Core tests no Sylvanie Williams families have opted out And Hardy is predicting the final round won\\u2019t be a problem for her scholars \\u201cThey\\u2019re used to it\\u201d she says simply\\n\\nEarly in the year diagnostic test results helped distinguish what had been taught from what had been learned Hardy keeps a close eye on lesson plans \\u2013 teachers submit them to her each week \\u2013 so she knows what material is being covered\\n\\nBy January armed with more data Hardy and her teachers and coaches were really poring over the test results And that\\u2019s when the dialogue around instruction began to shift The teachers started collaborating on how to quickly and directly backfill the specific foundational skills that students need to move forward\\n\\n\\u201cAfter that point\\u201d says fourthgrade teacher Terrance Mitchell \\u201cI think as a school we really started to see the achievement of our students begin to accelerate\\u201d\\n\\nAlthough Hardy is committed to running a testdriven school the data focus has its frustrations Because the Common Core exams are new this year the PARCC administrators need to perform technical calculations on the results This means that scores on the tests will be released to Hardy after Sylvanie Williams\\u2019s school year ends \\u2013 too late for teachers to use that data to coursecorrect\\n\\nState political leaders are maneuvering to scuttle or at least modify the use of the Common Core in Louisiana so it\\u2019s not certain that the standards that the students are being asked to meet this year will even be around next year\\n\\nThe school\\u2019s relentless focus on standards and testing reduces time for less defined but often more meaningful types of lessons \\u2013 ones that help kids understand themselves their fellow students and the world around them But Hardy has tried to squeeze these kinds of experiences into the school day\\n\\nIn January she took 40 students on a field trip to Selma Ala to join the commemorations of the 50th anniversary of the march to Montgomery And one morning she taught a unit on poverty in America which included having third fourth and fifthgraders compare weekly expenses with median income for high school dropouts college graduates and those with a master\\u2019s degree\\n\\nRecently a fifthgrade blackboard showed the remnants of a vibrant discussion about young black men police and excessive force \\u201cBecause of the demographic our children come from many will face immense challenges and unique realities\\u201d Hardy says\\n\\n\\u201cWe need to prepare them to understand how the world will engage with them They need to understand how to engage with it And maybe create the possibility that they will act as change agents in their world\\u201d\\n\\nHardy accepts that her school and her tenure as principal will be evaluated largely on test scores But she is adamant about maintaining what she sees as crucial parts of education that no test will measure\\n\\n\\u2022 This project is a partnership between the Monitor and The Hechinger

Hillary\\u2019s medical crises Guilty as Sin is available in bookstores and for order from Amazon \\nJames Comey\\u2019s decision to revive the investigation of Hillary Clinton\\u2019s email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI including some of his top deputies according to a source close to the embattled FBI director \\n\\u2018The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldn\\u2019t recommend an indictment against Hillary\\u2019 said the source a close friend who has known Comey for nearly two decades shares family outings with him and accompanies him to Catholic mass every week \\n\\u2018Some people including department heads stopped talking to Jim and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall\\u2019 said the source \\u2018They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist\\u2019 \\nAccording to the source Comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife Patrice \\nHe told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom \\n\\u2018He\\u2019s been ignoring the resignation letters in the hope that he could find a way of remedying the situation\\u2019 said the source \\n\\u2018When new emails that appeared to be related to Hillary\\u2019s personal email server turned up in a computer used her close aide Huma Abedin and Abedin\\u2019s disgraced husband Anthony Weiner Comey jumped at the excuse to reopen the investigation \\n\\u2018The people he trusts the most have been the angriest at him\\u2019 the source continued \\u2018And that includes his wife Pat She kept urging him to admit that he had been wrong when he refused to press charges against the former secretary of state \\n\\u2018He talks about the damage that he\\u2019s done to himself and the institution of the FBI and how he\\u2019s been shunned by the men and women who he admires and work for him It\\u2019s taken a tremendous toll on him \\n\\u2018It shattered his ego He looks like he\\u2019s aged 10 years in the past four months\\u2019 \\nBut Comey\\u2019s decision to reopen the case was more than an effort to heal the wound he inflicted on the FBI \\nHe was also worried that after the presidential election Republicans in Congress would mount a probe of how he had granted Hillary political favoritism \\nHis announcement about the revived investigation which came just 11 days before the presidential election was greeted with shock and dismay by Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the prosecutors at the Justice Department \\n\\u2018Jim told me that Lynch and Obama are furious with him\\u2019 the source said \\nAs I revealed in my latest New York Times bestseller Guilty As Sin Obama said that appointing Comey as FBI direct was \\u2018my worst mistake as president\\u2019 \\n\\u2018Lynch and Obama haven\\u2019t contacted Jim directly\\u2019 said the source

represents an attack on all member countries meaning the United States would be at war with Russia if Russian troops set foot in Baltic countries \\u201cA Russian attack on the Baltic states puts
